# QAfolio - API

There are two projects in this folder: _Drinks API with Postman and Newman_ and _Pets API with Cypress_.

**Drinks API with Newman**
I tested the Cocktail Free API  https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php (thanks Cocktail Team!) using Postman and I set up the Github Actions to run some basic tests (go to "Actions" tab to find the tests).

**Pets API with Cypress**
I created some basic tests for the Pet endpoint of Petstore https://petstore.swagger.io/#/ (thanks Petstore team!) using Cypress. For this project, I created specific api commands in /support/api_commands.js and added the tests in integration/api_tests.js.
