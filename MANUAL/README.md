# QAfolio - MANUAL

Thinking about how I would show some of my abilities in testing was a cool and hard process. I must confess that it took me some time to create the manual testing showcase part of my portfolio. My main concern was: if I document the process too much I may be seen as a boring and slow-moving tester (I am not!) but if I do not document... what will I show?

I really tried my best to keep it simple and focused and I hope you guys like it.
Now... before getting to the test plan, testcases and report file I created to show how I think when I need to structure a formal manual test plan for small-to-medium features, you must know that:

1. I know many times in an agile process there is not much space for structuring and detailing test cases, things are more fluid and the process less documented and I am used to that!
2. I do like reports and QA metrics, the report file show a little bit of this passion
3. I like studying and practing UX testing (and everything it envolves like usability and accessibility testing) in this test plan I tried showing it by using a contrast checker but I know in real life there are many topics to go through in order to verify the quality of the user experience and usability and accessibility guidelines' compliance
