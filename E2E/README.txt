Now let's talk about E2E automation!

There are two folders here: Cypress and Selenium.

In the first one, Cypress, you will find some end to end tests on (....). In this project I used cypress commands to structure the test code and I used the cypress-exe plugin to go through accessibility indicators using automation.

In the second folder, Selenium, you will find some basic end to end tests around the sign up flow on Netflix. In this project I used the page object pattern to structure the test code.
