# QAfolio - E2E

Now let's talk about E2E automation!

There are two folders here: _Cypress_ and _Selenium_.

**Cypress**
You will find some end to end tests on (....). In this project I used cypress commands to structure the test code and I used the cypress-exe plugin to go through accessibility indicators using automation.

**Selenium**
You will find some basic end to end tests around the sign up flow on Netflix. In this project I used the page object pattern to structure the test code.
